Secure Data Hiding System Using Steganography

Overview

This project implements a Secure Data Hiding System using Steganography, allowing users to securely embed secret messages within image files. The system ensures data confidentiality by encrypting the message and requires a passcode for retrieval.

Features

Text-based steganography: Hide secret messages inside images.

Password protection: Ensures only authorized users can decode.

Secure Encoding: Message is embedded in the least significant bits (LSB) of image pixels.

Message Extraction: Recovers the hidden message securely.

Encrypted Output: The decrypted message is displayed directly on the output image.
